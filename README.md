## Project Overview

### 1. Fractional Knapsack Problem
- **Goal**: Maximize the value of items carried in a knapsack with a limited volume.
- **Approach**: Greedy algorithm based on sorting items by value-to-weight ratio.
- **Files**:
  - `fractional_knapsack.py`: Python implementation
  - `pseudocode/knapsack_pseudocode.txt`: Step-by-step algorithm description

### 2. Vertex Coloring Problem
- **Goal**: Assign the minimum number of colors to graph vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
- **Approach**: Greedy graph coloring algorithm.
- **Files**:
  - `vertex_coloring.py`: Python implementation
  - `pseudocode/coloring_pseudocode.txt`: Step-by-step algorithm description
