Pseudocode for Vertex Coloring Algorithm:

Input: Graph G = (V, E) with vertices V and adjacency list adj
Output: Color assignments for each vertex using a minimum number of colors

1. Initialize colorassigned = [-1] * V (no colors assigned)
2. Assign the first vertex color 0: colorassigned[0] = 0
3. For each vertex i from 1 to V-1:
    a. Initialize usable = [False] * V (colors in use by neighbors)
    b. For each adjacent vertex j of i:
        - If colorassigned[j] != -1:
            - Mark usable[colorassigned[j]] = True
    c. Find the first unused color (lowest index where usable[color] == False)
    d. Assign that color to vertex i
    e. Reset usable for next vertex
4. Output the colorassigned list
